# Telegraf configuration

# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.

# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.

# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.

# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
  # rack = "1a"

# Configuration for telegraf agent

  # Telegraf will cache metric_buffer_limit metrics for each output, and will
  # flush this buffer on a successful write.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  # Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  # Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  # This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  # same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  # Default data flushing interval for all outputs. You should not set this below
  # interval. Maximum flush_interval will be flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "10s"
  # Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  # large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  # ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"
