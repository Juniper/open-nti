# OpenNTI

OpenNTI is a container packaged with all tools needed to collect and visualize time series data from network devices.
Data can be collected from different sources:

- **Data Collection Agent** : Collect data on devices using CLI/Shell or Netconf
- **Data Streaming Collector** : Take all data streamed by Juniper devices as Input (JTI, Analyticsd, soon Openconfig with gRPC)
- **Statsd interface** : Accept any Statsd packets

It's pre-configured with all tools and with a default dashboard ..
**Send it data, it will graph it**

Thanks to docker, it can run pretty much anywhere on server, on laptop ... on the device itself
